## 📌 Project Overview
The **Student Academic Companion App (LPU Touch)** is a mobile-first UI/UX design created to centralize all essential academic information for university students.  
Instead of navigating multiple portals for attendance, timetable, results, and notifications, students can access everything through a single, intuitive, and modern interface.

This project was fully designed and prototyped by me in Figma.
